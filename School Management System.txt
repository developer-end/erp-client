1.1 Introduction
The School Management System (SMS) is a web-based platform designed to automate and simplify the day-to-day operations of schools. It provides a centralized system for managing students, teachers, attendance, grades, fees, and communication between staff, students, and parents.
1.2 Objective
   * Streamline administrative tasks such as admissions, attendance, and fee management.

   * Provide easy access to academic and administrative data.

   * Enhance communication between teachers, students, and parents.

   * Ensure data accuracy, security, and efficient record management.

1.3 Scope
This project covers all essential modules required by a typical school:
      * Student registration and management

      * Teacher management

      * Class scheduling and timetable generation

      * Attendance tracking

      * Exam and grade management

      * Fee payment and receipt management

      * Parent access to student progress and attendance reports

2. System Analysis
2.1 Existing System
In many schools, administrative tasks are managed manually or through spreadsheets. This leads to:
         * Data redundancy and inaccuracy

         * Delays in information retrieval

         * Lack of real-time updates

         * Difficulty in communication

2.2 Proposed System
The proposed web-based SMS automates all manual tasks, provides a secure database, and supports real-time updates accessible from anywhere.
Key Benefits:
            * Centralized data management

            * Reduced paperwork

            * Enhanced transparency

            * Time-saving automation

            * Secure authentication and role-based access

3. System Design
3.1 System Architecture
Three-Tier Architecture:
               1. Presentation Layer (Frontend) – User interface for students, teachers, and admins.

               2. Application Layer (Backend) – Handles business logic and API endpoints.

               3. Database Layer – Stores all application data securely.

3.2 Use Case Diagram
Actors:
                  * Admin

                  * Teacher

                  * Student

                  * Parent

Main use cases:
                     * Admin manages users, classes, and reports.

                     * Teachers upload marks, attendance, and assignments.

                     * Students view grades, timetables, and announcements.

                     * Parents monitor student performance and fees.

3.3 Database Design
Tables (Example):
                        * students (id, name, class_id, dob, contact, parent_id)

                        * teachers (id, name, subject, email, phone)

                        * classes (id, name, section)

                        * subjects (id, name, class_id, teacher_id)

                        * attendance (id, student_id, date, status)

                        * marks (id, student_id, subject_id, exam_type, score)

                        * fees (id, student_id, amount, due_date, status)
